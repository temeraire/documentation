PacketDirect is PacketFabricâ€™s dedicated point-to-point connectivity product, and delivers secure, reliable, and cost-effective connectivity between any two points on the PacketFabric network, regardless of location.

PacketDirect is our most cost-effective solution for data transport between two locations. 

It supports a single EPL virtual circuit between the two endpoints; however, the creation of any further virtual circuits is restricted. If you wish to eliminate this restriction, our component products can be used to create a wide variety of networking solutions.
