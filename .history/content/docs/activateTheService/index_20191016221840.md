Once our PacketDirect service is finished provisioning, we generate the <a href="javascript:;" onmouseover="Tip('An LOA (also known as a letter of authorization) is a document that is usually physically signed by someone of authority. It grants permission for changes to be made and can authorize access to the physical sites.', WIDTH, 250, ABOVE, true)" onmouseout="UnTip()">Letters of Authorization (LOAs)</a>. We do that by clicking on the three dots on the far right-hand side and choosing ‘generate LOA:’

![Generate LOA](/img/GenerateLOA.jpg)

We’ll now choose to:

*   Generate the LOA for both sides at the same time, without selecting the option to email as an attachment 
*   Change who the LOA is made out to. (If, for instance we’re known as a different name at a <a href="javascript:;" onmouseover="Tip('In this context, a facility is a  colocation center (also known as a carrier hotel) where multiple providers all come together. Some providers may have a different legal entity name at one facility versus another, but still have common ownership. This is usually due to past mergers or acquisitions.', WIDTH, 250, ABOVE, true)" onmouseout="UnTip()">facility</a> we can go ahead and enter that name, as we’ve done below -- “Brand X.") 

![LOA Options](/img/LOAoptions.jpg)

Note that two tabs are created; these are our two LOAs, one of which is shown below, and that our changed name (“Brand X”) appears in the LOAs. We simply download them and send them in with our <a href="javascript:;" onmouseover="Tip('Cross connects are connections between different carriers or companies that take place in rooms at large points of presence, into which said companies have fiber running. Cross-connection is the attachment of one wire to another usually by anchoring each wire to a connecting block and then placing a third wire between them so that an electrical connection is made', WIDTH, 250, ABOVE, true)" onmouseout="UnTip()">cross connect</a> order.

Before we can pass traffic on this PacketDirect service we must take it out of testing mode (indicated below under STATUS). We  do that by coming back over to the right, clicking on the three dots, and selecting ‘View Package:’


![Remove Testing Mode](/img/RemoveTestingMode.jpg)

This loads the Package Details screen.  All we need do now is to click on ACTIVATE to activate the service:

![Activate the Service](/img/Activate.jpg)

And that's all there is to it!
